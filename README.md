## Introduction

Magic numbers are the first bits of a file or data stream
which uniquely identify the type of file or data stream.

For example when the first bits are "BM",
this identifies the file as a bitmap image file.

## Details

This gem infers based on widespread programming conventions for data file formats.

These magic numbers are by convention and we are using this guide:

Typical uses of magic numbers:

  * to quickly identify a file's data type
  * to check if data matches the file's MIME type or extension
  * to check if a web form file upload matches its HTTP content type
